Kubernetes:- It manages all the containers by providing cluster/Orchestration among them. 
=========    Monitoring, scailing, networking, load balancing, contorlling & Deploying an app in container, all these can be done by Kubernetes.
             If any container goes down, Immidiatly will restrat new container. If Complete node gets killed, Immdiatly it will shift the traffic on to other Node.
             It automatically takes care of Rollout & Rollback to avoide the downtime.
     
Componant:- a.) Secreate
            b.) Config Maps
     
Features:- i.) Automatic Bin Packing.
          ii.) Service Descovery & Load Balancing
         iii.) Storage Orchestartion
          iv.) Self-Healing
    
 
 Container >>> Pods >>> Worker Nodes(ec2) >>> Cluster
    

Cluster:- Its a collection of machines called node. Every cluster will have one Master Node & One Worker Node atleast.
          

Conainer:- It's an isolated space where you can deploy & run your application. It is compatible with all OS like:- Mac, Windows & Linux
           limit 300000 in a custer.

Pods:- Collection of containers. It could have one or more container. It gets own IP address. Pods
       Multiple Pods can be run in parallaer & can scale up as well.
       Limit is 15000 in a cluster.

Nodes:- Node could be a physical or Virtual Machine or EC2. Node will act like either Master or Worker. 
        It's a Collection of Pods. It could have one or more Pods. Master node manages both Worker Node & Pods.
        Limit is upto 5000 in a cluster. In a Node, you can have only 100 Pods.


Replication Controller (rc or rcs):- It makes sure that at any cost these or that numbers of Pods should be existed. If Pods failes than immidatly it can be replaced.
                         Replication controller gets info from Manifest file about how many container has to be run.
                         
  
Manifest File:- it Contains how many Pods should be available & than it tells to replications controller to maintain the desire no. of Pods.
